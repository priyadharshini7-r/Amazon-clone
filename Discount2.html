    <p>Frequently asked questions about Subscribe and Save.</p><hr color="#D3D3D3">
<h2>
    What is Subscribe and Save?
</h2>
<p>With Subscribe & Save, you'll enjoy free standard shipping on auto-deliveries (non-Prime customers may incur shipping costs for the first delivery), and the option to schedule deliveries on your Subscribe & Save delivery day. Eligible products often come at a discounted price on the Amazon price. You can cancel a subscription at any time.</p>
<h2>
    How can I create a Subscribe & Save (SnS) subscription?
</h2>
<p>
    To order a Subscribe & Save subscription:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Find a Subscribe & Save eligible item.</li>
    <li>Set your preferred quantity and frequency.</li>
    <li>Select Subscribe Now.</li>
    <li>Review your subscription address or select Change to edit it.</li>
    <li>The payment method will be set to payment link or AutoPay as per your settings.</li>
    <li>Review your subscription order and select Subscribe Now</li>
</ol>
<h2>
    What additional savings will I get with SnS?
</h2>
<p>
    You'll get a 5% discount on your first delivery. For subsequent months, you'll get 5% off when one or two subscriptions arrive the same day, and 10% off when three or more subscriptions arrive the same day.<br><br>

Note: If you are not an Amazon Prime member and have subscribed to 3 or more items and 1 or more of those are diapers, you will get 5% discount on diapers and 10% on other items, at the time of checkout. Prime members will save 10% on all diaper subscriptions, irrespective of the number of items subscribed.
</p>

<h2>
    What will be the Subscribe and Save discount applicable if I have a mix of diaper subscription and other item subscriptions?
</h2>
<p>
    If you're not an Amazon Prime member and you have 3 or more subscriptions scheduled for the same delivery date, you'll get 5% discount on the diaper items and 10% discount on the other items. Even if you have 3 different diaper subscriptions, you'll be eligible only for 5% discount on them.<br><br>

Note: If you are Amazon Prime member, then you will save 10% on all diaper subscriptions, irrespective of the number of items subscribed.
</p>

<h2>
    How can I pay for my Subscribe & Save auto-deliveries?
</h2>
<p>
    You can pay using any payment method for the first delivery of your Subscribe & Save order. For subsequent scheduled deliveries, you can use AutoPay on eligible payment methods (currently select credit and debit cards), Amazon Pay Balance (per eligibility), or pay manually via payment links.
To know more about these payment methods, visit &nbsp <a href="file:///C:/Users/Prathesha/OneDrive/Desktop/Hackathon/Discount.html">Manage Your Subscribe and Save Payment Method</a>
</p>

<h2>
    When will I get the delivery of the items to which I have subscribed?
</h2>
<p>
    As soon as you create your first subscription, the items you've ordered will ship immediately with free standard shipping. Your order will be delivered to you on or before the estimated delivery date on your order. This delivery date will automatically be set as the delivery date for future deliveries of the subscribed items, unless you manually change it. You can select a frequency (1 to 6-month intervals) for every item. Automatic orders will be created on the monthly delivery day based on the frequency set.<br><br>
</p>

<h2>
    After I create a subscription, will I get all future orders at the same price at which I subscribed?
</h2>
<p>
    The seller reserves the right to change the price at any time. The price applicable to your subscription order is based on the price of your Subscribe & Save items on the day your order is generated. If an item has already been shipped before the price changed, you'll need to pay according to the old price for that item on that order.<br><br>
